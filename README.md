# GenAI_Projects
End-to-end Generative AI learning with day-wise Python notebooks covering LLM fundamentals, embeddings, prompt engineering, transformers, vector databases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and practical applied use cases for real-world AI applications.


📌 Overview

This repository contains day-wise Python notebooks based on my Generative AI learning journey. Each day focuses on a new concept, starting from fundamentals to advanced applications, implementing theory with hands-on coding.

🧑‍💻 Topics Covered

✅ Introduction to Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)

✅ Embeddings and semantic search

✅ Prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)

✅ Transformers and attention mechanism basics

✅ Vector Databases (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)

✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines

✅ Fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific tasks

✅ Applied projects & real-world use cases
